This is the The Odin Project's project: "Rock Paper Scissors" in their Foundations Course.
I will write the pseudocode here for accountability. 

A function named getComputerChoice will make a random selection between rock, paper, or scissors.
A function named getHumanChoice will return a VALID choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
Create two variables, one for the human score, one for the computer score.
Create a function named playRound, that compares the human choice vs the computer choice.
Rework the playRound function as playGame, so that there are 5 rounds played, with scores tallied at the end and a winner declared.
Rework the code so that the prompt can be called over and over again in the loop, as well as the computer option.
